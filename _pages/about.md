Hi there!ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm a MSc student in Robotics and Computation at [University College London (UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk). My academic interest is deeply rooted in the fascinating realms of reinforcement learning, learning representations and reasoning, and robotics. 

Prior to UCL, I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree from [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn) in 2023. I worked as a research assistant at [Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA)](http://english.ia.cas.cn), working on developing navigation and target detection methods for mobile robots. I also did a summer internship at [Tencent](https://www.tencentcloud.com), working on developing and implementing object detection and tracking algorithms.

I'm constantly exploring how machines can learn and adapt to new environments, solve practical problems, and interact with the world around them. My projects range from building intelligent robotic systems to developing advanced algorithms.

This website is my digital playground share some my projects and work. Feel free to reach out â€” I look forward to hearing from you!ðŸ˜ŠðŸ¤–
