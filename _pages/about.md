Hi there!ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm a MSc student in Robotics and Computation at [University College London (UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk). My academic interest is deeply rooted in the fascinating realms of reinforcement learning, learning representations and reasoning, and robotics. 

Prior to UCL, I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree from [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn) in 2023. I also did summer internships at [Tencent](https://www.tencentcloud.com), working on developing and implementing object detection and tracking recognition algorithms.

I'm constantly exploring how machines can learn and adapt to new environments, solve complex problems, and interact with the world around them. My projects range from building intelligent robotic systems to developing advanced algorithms.

This website is my digital playground where I showcase some of the projects I've worked on. It's a space to share my work, and I'm always excited to connect with others who share my interests. Feel free to reach outâ€”I look forward to hearing from you!ðŸ˜ŠðŸ¤–
